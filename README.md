# Uncovering the Drivers of Stagnant Ecommerce Sales

Using a detailed RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, I identified critical insights such as:
1. 71.51% of users are inactive, not making transactions in the past six months.
2. 90.14% of customers are one-time buyers, highlighting a significant retention issue.
3. A strong correlation between voucher expenses and sales performance, emphasizing the need for a robust promotional strategy.
This project underscores the importance of understanding customer behavior and operational factors in driving business success.
